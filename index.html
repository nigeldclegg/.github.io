            <h3>Our Current Reality:</h3>
            <p>Right now, a few wealthy individuals control most of the world's resources while billions struggle with basic needs. This isn't because there isn't enough - we already produce enough food, have enough technology, and possess sufficient knowledge to provide abundance for everyone. The problem is our money system that creates artificial scarcity to generate profit for the few.</p>
            
            <p>Money forces people into meaningless jobs just to survive. It drives environmental destruction because profit matters more than the planet. It concentrates power in the hands of those who can accumulate the most wealth, regardless of their wisdom or compassion. Most of your stress, anxiety, and limitations come from this single system.</p>

            <h4>You've heard since childhood that "money is the root of all evil" - but what if we actually took that seriously and eliminated money entirely?</h4>

            <h3>Why Change Is Now Possible:</h3>
            <p>For the first time in human history, we have the technology to automate most essential work. Vertical farming can produce abundant food in small spaces. Renewable energy can power everything cleanly. AI can coordinate transport and logistics perfectly. 3D printing can manufacture goods efficiently. We can literally provide abundance for everyone without destroying the planet.</p>

            <p>The only thing stopping us is the money system itself - because abundance isn't profitable for those who profit from scarcity.</p>

            <h3>The Simple Solution:</h3>
            <p>Eliminate money entirely. Not replace it, not reform it - eliminate it completely. People contribute what they can and take what they need. Communities coordinate through voluntary cooperation. Technology serves human needs rather than generating profit.</p>

            <p>This isn't paying for anything differently - it's recognizing that we already have everything needed, and money just gets in the way of distributing it sensibly.</p>

            <p>Picture a world where the very concept of buying and selling disappears. No bills to pay, no prices to compare, no financial transactions of any kind. Every person has abundant access to housing, food, transport, healthcare, education without any form of payment because these things simply exist for everyone.</p>

            <p>This creates a gift economy where people contribute what they can, take what they need, and help because it feels good and builds community. Projects happen because people care about them, not because someone can profit from them.</p>

                What would your morning look like without any financial stress?

        <!-- Answer 1 -->
        <div id="answer-1" class="content-text hidden">
            <p>Imagine waking up naturally and never once thinking about money. No checking bank balances with anxiety. No mental calculation of bills due this week. No panic about whether you can afford groceries or rent. The constant background anxiety that most people carry simply doesn't exist because money doesn't exist.</p>

            <p>Picture breakfast ingredients available from community gardens and food systems - fresh, abundant, no grocery shopping required. You actually have time to taste your food, to sit and enjoy the morning, maybe chat with neighbors over coffee. Your mental energy, freed from survival worry, flows naturally toward curiosity, relationships, and creativity.</p>

            <p>No bills, no job insecurity, no health insurance stress, no retirement planning. Mental energy freed up for curiosity, relationships, and creativity. During lockdown when basic needs were provided, people discovered their anxiety was often work-related rather than personal failing. Without money systems creating survival pressure, that anxiety simply disappears.</p>
